# Camera Metadata Toolkit (camdkit)

## Introduction

_THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS_

The toolkit implements the [SMPTE RIS OSVP camera metadata
model](https://www.smpte.org/rapid-industry-solutions/on-set-virtual-production).
The objective is to validate the model as well lower barrier to adoption.

```
Camera file from Vendor #1 --
                              \
Camera file from Vendor #2 ------ OSVP metadata model -------- JSON
                              /
Camera file from Vendor #3 --
```

The toolkit works by extracting metadata from various sources, e.g. camera
files, and converting it into a single internal model that follows the metadata
model currently in development by the SMPTE RIS OSVP effort. The internal model
can then be serialized into representations such as JSON.

The model documentation is [auto-generated](https://smpte.github.io/ris-osvp-metadata-camdkit/).

## How to extend

* source readers, e.g. RED Camera reader at `src/main/python/red`.
* metadata model at `src/main/python/model.py`

## Quick start and demo

* clone this repo

`git clone ...`

* install Python (https://www.python.org/)

* install pipenv

`pip install --user pipenv`

* install dependencies

`pipenv install --dev`

* set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to `src/main/python`, e.g.

`export PYTHONPATH=src/main/python`

* convert RED camera files

`pipenv run python src/main/python/camdkit/red/cli.py src/test/resources/red/A001_C066_0303LZ_001.static.csv src/test/resources/red/A001_C066_0303LZ_001.frames.csv`
