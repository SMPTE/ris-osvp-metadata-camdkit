  "description": "A list of transforms.\nTransforms are composed in order with the last in the list representing\nthe X,Y,Z in meters of camera sensor relative to stage origin.\nThe Z axis points upwards and the coordinate system is right-handed.\nY points in the forward camera direction (when pan, tilt and roll are\nzero).\nFor example in an LED volume Y would point towards the centre of the\nLED wall and so X would point to camera-right.\nRotation expressed as euler angles in degrees of the camera sensor\nrelative to stage origin\nRotations are intrinsic and are measured around the axes ZXY, commonly\nreferred to as [pan, tilt, roll]\nNotes on Euler angles:\nEuler angles are human readable and unlike quarternions, provide the\nability for cycles (with angles >360 or <0 degrees).\nWhere a tracking system is providing the pose of a virtual camera,\ngimbal lock does not present the physical challenges of a robotic\nsystem.\nConversion to and from quarternions is trivial with an acceptable loss\nof precision.\n",
